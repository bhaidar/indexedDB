IndexedDB tutorial
Step by Step IndexedDB full Tutorial 

I found out recently about indexedDB that exists in the browser! and wanted to make a video tutorial about it. I got say the API is clunky but that did not stop me from making the video. I first explain the eventing that get triggered when you open the database, onupgradeneeded, onsuccess, onerror and when each are triggered. Then we dive into creating objectstore, then transactions both writing and reading. Pretty cool technology. Enjoy the tutorial guys
